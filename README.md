Description:
Because nested for loops align with the row-and-column structure of a multiplication table, I used them in Challenge 3. The inner loop inserts the appropriate product into each column while the outer loop manages the rows. This facilitates the clear and structured generation and formatting of all combinations from 1 to 10.
